# Copper

Copper is a high level language and compiler that compiles to mindustry logic.
The syntax is similar to rust, with some differences. (these will be documented at some point.)

This repository contains the compiler (and currently everything else related to the language.)

## but why make this? you ask

You may be wondering why I went to all this trouble, when things like [go-mlog](https://github.com/Vilsol/go-mlog) exist.

The answer is, ~~because i wanted to~~. Instead of being just a codegen layer on top of an existing lexer+parser *cough* go-mlog *cough*
this uses a fully custom lexer, parser, codegen, etc, the whole deal. This is mostly because I wanted to try and make a compiler (it cant be *that* hard, right?) and also somewhat so that I could use it to acutally make mlog code.

## How to use

its currently unfinished, but it is a cli program, so try running it there and see what happens :shrug:
